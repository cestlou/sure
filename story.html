Sure

<br /><br />

<br />  Do you remember the phrase “Blood is thicker than wine”? Turns out it’s true. I mean, I’m sure once it coagulated, blood would absolutely be thicker. But even right out of a vein, blood reminded me of agave.
<br />  The alarm clock struck a loud, irking noise into the air. Startled, I awoke and slammed my palm onto it, dew drops of perspiration dripping from my forehead down to the dirty blonde roots of my hair. Eyes barely open, I checked the weather. “90 before 10AM,” I thought to myself. From above I heard the sound of the upstairs neighbors fighting; to the side, the capricious couple in an upswing, fucking their brains out. Looking down at my palm I noticed a pile of green puss lie in the center. On the alarm clock, the carcass of a large cockroach. “Another day in paradise.”
<br />  I wasn’t extraordinary. My light mocha skin, the rolls my belly made when I slouched, my natural black twists of hair, the crookedness of my smile. All I did was stand out in the sea of thin, tall, porcelain skinned “aspiring models” of the Los Angeles metropolis. A girl from my work, she was at least 5'11" and had the smallest waist I'd ever seen. She once talked about how she had bought her shirt from the toddler’s section at a Disney store. Mind boggling. Not that I wanted to be that skinny, but... I felt like a blob-fish. I dyed my hair to blend in, and it only made me look even more out of place. People generally sucked. I was thankful for Del Taco, my eyebrow pencil, and a nice breeze.
Arriving at work I tossed my faded knockoff leather bag on the table in the back, and checked my phone one more time before heading out onto the retail floor. Three missed calls from Mom. I put my phone back in my pocket and dragged myself to the front.
<br />  At the end of my shift, my boss Amanda was working on the computer in the back. As I clocked out, I said casually, “Well, thanks for this great opportunity working here. But, I quit.” She gave her fake-bitch puzzled face. “Well, okay I guess. I’ll get the paperwork.” “No, you misunderstand. I’m done.” “Wow.” She crossed her arms over her silicone DD’s. “If you walk out like this I won’t be able to give you a reference.” “Not needed,” I retorted. I snatched up my bag and left.
<br />  The final three months had been a massive upswing for me. Getting an apartment was a huge deal. No more being kicked out of the car I was staying in with my Mom and her creepy, asshole Armenian boyfriend. Most recently, she had kicked me out after I had a conflict with Kenady, my oldest sister. It was a crazy deranged fight, and I ended up sitting in a 24-hour McDonald's the entire night. Wasn’t the first time, but with each disagreement, the cool-off times got longer and longer. I didn’t like being away from my cats; I already felt guilty enough making them live in a car for an extended period of time. Putting them in that apartment relieved a massive amount of stress for me. Despite this, I was still miserable. What was wrong with me? I shouldn’t have blamed myself for my mental health problems, but I did. My family had a genetic predisposition to guilt.
<br />  My cellphone buzzed atop the crooked table I’d picked up on the curb one day on my walk home from the bus. Mom again… I’d been ignoring her calls. She was close to dying; with severe rheumatoid arthritis, nerve damage in her right hand and arm, heart problems, and pre-diabetes, you could say she got a shitty hand at life. She wasn’t perfect, and she could be a prodigious pain in the ass, but at the end of the day, I hurt for her more than I did for myself. I answered the phone. “Hey Mom.” 
<br />  “And what on Earth could be so important that you can’t answer the damn phone for days?” she snapped back. It was as though I could have answered the phone and said nothing. She never left voicemails; she needed a beating heart to bitch to. She went on to explain that her doctor at the county clinic told her that her heart is on its last lap. She’d know more after her appointment in three days. I asked if I could help, and she immediately rejected, quickly ending the conversation. Everyone in the family was distant, stubborn; ashamed to ask for help. This made up my mind. As I packed my final bag, it felt like I was preparing for my final pilgrimage to the Aokigahara forest without a tent.
<br />  It needed to be poetic. For once, I wanted control of my life; even if it was to end it. The journey to the San Bernardino Forest took about a week. I’m no hiker by any means, and shit, a 4,437-foot elevation gain is no joke. For each ~1,000-foot gain I took the night to re-charge, each evening a bit colder than the last. During this time, I wrote a lot of letters to people I haven’t spoken to in years, apologizing. It made me chuckle. I’m choosing to end my life and I’m still apologizing to people for the burden of my existence. Finally, I arrived at Cucamonga Peak, elevation 8,859 feet.
<br />  The peak overlooked what seemed like all of Southern California. What a beautiful a place to die. With my backpack still on, I peeked over the ledge. Steep drop, guaranteed death. It’s a good thing I was never scared of heights. I gave myself a few moments of contemplation. A couple of times I thought I’d heard someone’s footsteps nearby, but each time I turned around I was met with the view of the open plain.
What was so burdensome about me? I really liked myself, but every human interaction tore my confidence down. Why do I let people I don’t respect in the slightest deplete my self-worth? Whose life was I trying to live? The feeling of doubt syringed a numbing tingle into my entire body, realizing how close I was to death. Oh, shit. Who was going to take care of the cats?
<br />  Just then, my phone buzzed and I lost my footing on the cliff. My 99¢ store flip-flops slid on some pebbles atop the large rock on which I was standing. Well, I guess that’s it then. I kinda had a feeling my Mother would be the death of me. But somehow, by the grace of a God I did not believe in, I found my footing. Heart now residing in my ass, I answered the phone. My Mom said her doctor found her a heart. The family of the deceased had insisted it go to someone with my Mother’s ailments. No idea how that works, but I was elated to hear it. She might have a chance yet. “Where are you? Let’s go celebrate! Dinner’s on me.” “Mom… I’ll pay. You are the person we’re celebrating, after all. My treat to your new lease on life.” My Mom lived out of a 1980 Volkswagen Vanagon; she couldn’t even afford her insulin. But she got a second chance, and so will I. It felt good to sense hope. That didn’t happen often, so I trusted it.  Shitty thing about life, though, in your unthankful absence you can find your spot already taken.
<br />  I turned around to leave, only to find an abnormally massive coyote standing inches behind me. My ears were suddenly hot and I felt like prey, unknowing of a beast lurking inches away. A victim once more. It’s ears were down, snout to the ground, making it look as though it were bowing. Well... I suppose in hindsight that’s what it looked like. At first glance, I didn’t consider the fact that his teeth weren’t gnarling, nor that his tail was wagging like an excited puppy. But who looks at a coyote the size of a brown bear and is reminded of a friendly golden retriever? Yet again, those damn flip-flops. I lost my footing once more, but there was no catching it this time. Before tumbling off the cliff, I hit the base of my skull, hard. Turned out I’d be grateful for this because it paralyzed me, and thus sheltered me from what I assume was horribly unbearable pain.
<br />  I’ll spare you most of the gory details. Yea, you’re welcome. It was gross. My vision was pretty fucked once I stopped rolling to my death; mostly because I lost my contacts, depending entirely on my 20-650 eyesight. So I couldn’t see a lot of what had happened to me. Just a lot of brownish red and searing streaks in the air from the scorching sun. I wasn’t as sad or disappointed as you’d probably assume. Or maybe you’re thinking, I should be in more pain. Like I said, I never thought I’d be thankful to be paralyzed from the neck down, but there I laid.
<br />  Just then, a large gray blob found its way to my side. I assumed it was Coyote, retrieving his kill. Though, out of his snout came the words, “Goodness, am I sorry. I should have known better. Sometimes I forget I’m a coyote, if you can believe it. Probably quite unsettling to find nearly breathing down your neck. Are you in pain?” 
<br />  Oh wow, so the blood loss was that bad. I’m hallucinating. Cool, I’ll roll with it. “Actually, no, I think I broke my neck on the way down. I’m mostly just thirsty.” I was surprised I could still talk, however strained the words seemed to pour out. I might have punctured a lung. “Oh, well,” he turned, and began rummaging through a sack. His blurred snout then returned to focus with my Evian water bottle delicately cradled between his rows of sharp, yellow teeth. “I foun thith in your aag” he said, suddenly biting the bottle with seemingly little effort, drenching my face with water.
<br />  It took a few minutes for the endorphins to wear off, and though I couldn’t feel my limbs, I sure as hell started to feel some serious pain. I kept waiting for him to pick me up between those rows of huge, sharp teeth. After a few moments in silence, he spoke again. “Look. I don’t want to disrespect your privacy. But… I can hear you thinking. Everything you say to yourself. I do rather appreciate your lack of anger with me, though I don’t share the same sentiments toward myself. I know you’d just decided to reconsider jumping. Thing is, the thoughts I receive from others’ minds aren’t transmitted in real-time. They come in like live television; there’s a delay. In a morbid way, I wanted to watch a human take their own life. I’ve not seen that before in the thousands of years I’ve been roaming this forest. Also, please know I’m not going to eat you. You ever try something once and immediately you know you hate it? Human is like that for me.” Wow, so on top of delusions, I have an asshole of a delusion at that. At least he wasn’t going to ingest me, or so he said. I would’ve retorted with something clever but it seemed as though the fluid in my lungs had filled to the point that I couldn’t speak. Another few moments passed.
<br />  “Okay, so… You don’t have much time. And in this quiet, I’ve done some digging through your ‘archives,’ so to speak. I’m sorry for your pain. What you feel now, as well as that which you’ve carried for the better part of your consciousness. I have sorrow in my heart as well. For the last 3,000 years, I’ve roamed alone. I have tendencies of my species, but my cognizance permits me more intricate needs of emotional and intellectual variety. Long story short, I’m horribly lonely. And it seems as though you are too. If I leave you here, you’ll be dead in less than ten minutes. However, if you’d like to join me, I can permit you an existence eternal as a Demigod. I can promise you benevolence and camaraderie. In exchange, simply, I’d like a friend. Your canine coat will repel heat much more effectively than your current outfit, so you’ll never feel much discomfort in that respect, and you’ll be more agile than you’d ever imagined. I don’t want to get your hopes up, but… there is a slight, minor chance I’d be able to heal your body. Your injuries are severe enough for me to doubt myself when I say that. But, if I can, you will have the ability to shape-shift back and forth. I’ll give you the respect of a moment to consider. But given that you can no longer speak, I’ll still be listening to your thoughts.”
<br />  If this wasn’t an illusion… If I were really just offered eternal life, would I even want it? It was shitty that I’d finally wanted to live in the same instant I was destined to die. But life as a coyote, and forever at that? The idea seemed kind-of gross. Would life as a canine be worse than death? Though he might be able to fix me. Human me. I didn’t want to get hung up on the idea, it seemed like a pipe dream. Just how bad were my injuries? As I considered these things, my fingertips were met with a sticky substance. At first, I thought it was Coyote pouring agave on me... Weird. But as my eyes focused in on my waistline, I was finally able to witness the extent of my wounds. The blood touching my fingers came directly out of my left wrist, slit from my forearm to my palm. Slung over my gut, the stream caught on the index finger of my right hand almost immediately upon leaving my body. It was thick, like the paste my sisters and I used as kids to stick glitter onto construction paper. I mustered enough strength for my vocal chords to strum one more word.
<br />  “Sure.”
